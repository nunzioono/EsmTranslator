BOOK->DESC:b'<font face=\'$HandwrittenFont\'> \r\nHey man,\r\n  I was in Bunker Hill the other day and Deb said you came by.  Said you weren\'t looking so good either.  I know you\'re trying to make a name for yourself but I don\'t think the Triggermen are right for you.  I just think it\'s gonna lead to a bad place.\r\n\r\n  And I hear you\'re still rocking that plastic ring you stole from that ghoul which you think is gonna save your life one day.  You\'ve been wanting folks to call you "Lucky Chucky" since you were a kid.  I keep telling you that\'s not how nicknames work.

I think I'll fit right in, as you said I would obviously.\r\n\r\n   I met a couple of pals that decided to help me. They wanted to learn how to grow pups. We feed into a local group just a ways down from us. The leader didn't want the doggies around, allergic he says, but I don't mind. We are scouts anyway.\r\n\r\n   The tub works perfect as a feeding trough. The dogs love it. It's just where you said it would be. There's also a robot here but we haven't been able to get it running. Tech ain't my strong suit.\r\n   \r\n   Anyway, not sure when I'll be able to send this out in case it feels like I've forgotten about you.

The Vault Dweller has been able to interview some of those that were brave enough to tell their stories. \r\n   Griff, a retired man tells the horrifying story of a group of Super Mutants destroying his farm and murdering his partner! "Without blinking an eye he swings his giant club and takes my poor wife\'s head clean off like it was some 4th of July pumpkin!". \r\n   Laney, a dear old lady informs us of a truly ghastly attack by Super Mutants that\'s straight out of the pages of a horror story. "When I went to look for poor Ralphie all I found was a pile of blood and guts and then those big green buggers were upon us!"\r\n   And finally, there is the truly tragic tale of Ricky, a young man just out of his teens, who tragically lost his entire family to Super Mutants! "I saw my parents ripped apart! I close my eyes at night and it all plays out like some horror show over and over and over again!"\r\n   It is my duty to bring you the TRUTH. And the truth presented here is that the muties are a danger to us all that NEEDS to be taken care of.\r\n   Stay tuned Commonwealth, as we bring you more stories from across the Wasteland, most important are the atrocities being perpetuated by the Super Mutant scourge!\r\n   We are the Voice and we will be heard!\r\n</font></p>\x00'

He is a sewage technician who was working away one day when he heard a commotion nearby. "Those mutie monsters absolutely tore the place up. They were putting the hurt on anyone they could get their hands on!" He goes on to describe the feeling of being "trapped" and barely escaping with his life. A true tale of terror if I ever heard one.\r\n   And then we have the truly tragic story of little Dahlia. Poor Dahlia was innocently playing when she spotted a vicious Super Mutant approaching. "He was walking past and he *smashed* my trolley! I was really scared and thought he was going to EAT ME next!" As you can see not only are Super Mutants attacking anyone they can, they are even coming after defenseless, innocent children! \r\n   If something isn\'t done, and I mean SOON, I don\'t even want to speculate on how bad this will get.
